							<p>I transferred to UCR in Fall 2019 and graduated in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the Bourns College of Engineering. My time there was about scale—more advanced material, tighter timelines, and a bigger academic stage. I didn’t breeze through it; I had to improve quickly and repeatedly.</p>
							<p>Across six quarters, I completed over 95 units at UCR, maintaining a 3.25 GPA. I worked through everything from Compiler Design and Operating Systems to Embedded Systems, AI, and Formal Logic. I also tackled the more human side of the field, with courses in Technical Communication, Information Retrieval, and two capstone projects; one in Graphics and Game Development and another in Embedded Systems.</p>
							<p>Some courses challenged me more than others—like Discrete Structures and Database Systems—but I didn’t fold. I looped back, improved, and kept my GPA climbing through every quarter. I ended on a strong note: multiple A's in my final term, including in Game Development and Information Retrieval.</p>
							<p>UCR is where I took all the foundational knowledge from MSJC and stress-tested it. I walked away with not just a degree, but the kind of mental endurance and technical breadth that only comes from wrestling with systems that are way bigger than you—until they’re not.</p>
