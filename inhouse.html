							<h2>My Main Discord Bot Creation</h2>
                            <h5>Images with descriptions of the bot in the section below.</h5>
							<p><b>TLDR:</b>I built a Discord bot to automate in-game ranking and match tracking for a League of Legends community. Before, moderators updated spreadsheets manually, which slowed games down. I learned state management, file-based persistence, and API integration to automate the whole system. It cut game setup times and kept players more engaged. It was also my first real project where I taught myself coding by solving various problems. <b>HOVER THIS SECTION TO READ THE ENTIRE EXPLANATION</b></p>
                            <ul class="hidden-text">
								<p>I am honestly the most proud of one of my discord bots that I made when I was just learning how to code, before I even obtained my Associates degree.</p>
								<p>For this, I have to explain the reason for development. I play a videogame called League of Legends, it is a competitive game that has 5 players against 5 players, the best team wins. I used to play a custom 5v5 game mode in a Discord server, they called the inhouses. The moderators of the server kept a spreadsheet with the list of players and had a ranking ladder with everyone in there. They manually updated the scores on the winning team and losing team. This work was very tedious and slow, it caused delays between games while the rankings and scores were updated for everyone.</p>
								<p>I pitched the idea of coding a bot that automates the process and provides visuals and a ladder to represent the idea. They liked it and that’s how I began my first large project.</p>
								<p>For this project basically everything was a major challenge because I was just learning how to code and I just jumped in. The first major part of the structure was that I had to prevent code from running during specific situations but I also didn’t want to make a ton of if else statements everywhere for this. So I looked up ideas on what I could do and learned about states. </p>
								<p>Basically it took a command from a moderator to start a new lobby, and it started a new state where players in chat signed up to join the lobby and once it filled all 10 players in the lobby, the moderator could start the drafting. Here a new state started where players could no longer sign up, the moderator would then decide to either randomize the players between teams, or follow the usual rules where the top 2 players become captains, then in code I set those 2 players to be able to pick their team, they alternated picks like you would do in gym class 1 by 1 until all none are left. Once that was done, the game was started and that specific game was saved in memory as a “room” to later on decide who the winner is, this also went back to idle state. Where a second lobby could be made if there were still players remaining that wanted to play.</p>
								<p>I also had to learn how to store the ranking of the players and I had heard about databases but I didn’t know anything about them, but I knew somewhat about csv files. So I decided to store player data in csv files and update them. I also had to create a mathematical algorithm to give players an increase in their LadderPoints based on the average rank of their team vs the rank of the enemy team and their win streaks. The rankings mattered because the top players in the server would receive monetary rewards at the end of the season.</p>
								<p>Outside of the lobby, players could call various commands to see current running games, a ladder, their specific stats, other player’s specific stats, a list of commands, and other various commands that are irrelevantish.</p>
								<p>I also wanted to display the amount of points a player went up or down after a game, so to do that I had to learn about graphics and how to edit an image with code. I basically sent an edited image that showed both sides of the players showing their win or loss of points.</p>
								<p>I was also asked to code a verification tool for the server to verify that players are real and I also did that within the same bot. So I learned how to implement APIs and used Riot Games API as verification for the server. Basically how I made it work was that the use joined the server, was asked to verify by submitting their player name and I would then call to the RiotGames API and verified that the user existed, then I had that user change the in-game icon to a random icon from one that the bot picked, once they did that, the user would be verified as a real player and would be allowed into the server to play.</p>
								<p>This project took me about 6-8 months to first get it to working conditions and actually running on the server permanently replacing the manual workers. And about 1.5 to 2 years to its fully fledged version with all its bells and whistles. First it was just to get it to work, then it was adding and optimizing new and old features. This project was very hard because I started this as I took my first programming class, basically I learned how to write “Hello World” a few months prior to this large project. I also didn’t know about modularity at this point in time so it was all mainly in one large file with like 4,000-5,000 lines of code. With the exception of some, I knew how to make classes in Java so I made some required for my code and accidentally made it modular in some parts because I coded some parts in these classes.</p>
